# My-first-Landing
Landing page of a server company
Hi, this is my first landing page. This page is fully responsible, 
I used BEM nesting in HTML tags classes. 
Also instead of clear CSS i used SCSS due to opportunities it gives.

Since this is my first experience please don't be very strict but i appreciate every comment and review. 

PS. While you deploing my landing on GitHub Pages some of the images can not render. So i reccomend reload page a few times. The problem should solve)

Thanks for reading, i hope you'll like my work
